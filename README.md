# SharePoint “ToolShell” Case Study (Sanitized)

> **TL;DR**: .  
> **Status**: Reported on [2025-07-23];

## Overview
- **Component/Surface**: [e.g., SharePoint X endpoint]
- **Impact**: [RCE / auth bypass / data exposure] — high-level, no exploit chain.
- **Environment**: [lab, version], PoC remains private.

## Method (High-level)
1) Recon surface → 2) Controlled lab reproduction → 3) Root cause analysis.  
*No step-by-step exploit or payloads in public.*

## Indicators & Detection (Safe to share)
- Log patterns (sanitized)
- Hypothesis for Sigma/KQL (pseudocode, not weaponizable)

## Mitigation & Remediation
- Hardening: [config changes], [WAF rules], [least privilege]

## Timeline
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Discovery (lab)
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Responsible disclosure sent
- [YYYY-MM-DD] Vendor acknowledgement / patch

## Credits & Ethics
- Research by @vickern-tan.  
- This repo omits exploit code and sensitive artifacts to prevent abuse.
